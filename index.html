              In the 2018 club season, <span class="impact">CHAOTIC GOOD</span>
              will bring together a group of dedicated ultimate players to build
              friendships, embrace the spirit of the game, and push each other to
              the highest levels of competition.

              A chaotic good character does what is necessary to bring about change
              for the better, disdains bureaucratic organizations that get in the
              way of social improvement, and places a high value on personal freedom,
              not only for oneself, but for others as well.
