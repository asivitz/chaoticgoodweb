              One year has passed. The group of adventurers known as <span class="impact">CHAOTIC GOOD</span> decides to, once again, compete in the sport known as Ultimate. They will build friendships, embrace the spirit of the game, and push each other to the highest levels of competition.

              A chaotic good character does what is necessary to bring about change
              for the better, disdains bureaucratic organizations that get in the
              way of social improvement, and places a high value on personal freedom,
              not only for oneself, but for others as well.
