              A chaotic good character does what is necessary to bring about change
              for the better, disdains bureaucratic organizations that get in the
              way of social improvement, and places a high value on personal freedom,
              not only for oneself, but for others as well.

          <h3>What we will expect from you</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We anticipate a few more weekends off this year and a little more flexibility as compared to usual to allow people time to travel and see their friends and family.
              But, in general, attendance is important to this team.
              <ul>
                <li>There will be 1-2 practices per weekend. And again, more weekends off this year than typical.</li>
                <li>Tournament schedule is still TBD. At a minimum- Boston Invite (7/17/21 - 7/18/21) and the series.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fitness, including work outside of practice.</li>
            <li>A willingness to work on weaknesses and consider feedback from others, and also to help teammates improve</li>
            <li>Respect for your teammates and opponents</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What you can expect from the team</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A fun, high-energy practice atmosphere</li>
            <li>A comprehensive frisbee education (including handler and cutter defense, cutting technique, lots of footwork, disc skills, and more)</li>
            <li>A strong drive to compete and win</li>
            <li>Enough perspective to know that winning shouldn't come at the expense of enjoyment and respect for teammates and opponents</li>
            <li>A strong social game</li>
          </ul>
